# shafty

Prototype ClojureScript functional reactive programming library. Shafty
is just an experiment and shouldn't be used in production.  Shafty is
currently in development.

## Usage

### Events

Events represent time-varying functions which have a finite set of
occurences over time.  Create an event and generate a receiver for the
event, which can either be bound to a DOM element via an
addEventListener, set as the callback for a timer, or a result of an
XmlHttpRequest.

```clojure
(def my-event (shafty/event))

(def my-event-receiver (shafty/generate-receiver my-event
                                          (fn [x] (identity x))))
```

Compose event streams using filter!, map!, reduce!, etc.

```clojure
(def my-filtered-event (shafty/filter! my-event
                                (fn [x] (= 1 x))))

(def my-mapped-event (shafty/map! my-event
                           (fn [x] (identity 1))))
```

Behaviours are time-varying functions which constantly have a value.
Derive a behaviour from an event, or generate a receiver to watch a
particular DOM element, such as an input field.

```clojure
(def my-behaviour-of-ones (shafty/hold! my-filtered-event 2))
```

## TODO

* Don't use watchers, store a sink of nodes to propgate forward to, and
  call a selection-fn on the members of the sink.
* Investigate adding sources vector to Event/Behaviour.
* Add to IEventStream:
  * reduce!
  * merge!
  * delay!
* Behaviours value should only change when deref'd?
* Text box save example.
