# shafty

ClojureScript functional reactive programming library.

## Disclaimer

Shafty is currently under development and the API is subject to change.

Shafty shouldn't be used in production.

Get in touch if you are interested in helping out.

## Usage

### Events

Events represent time-varying functions which have a finite set of
occurences over time.

### Behaviours

Behaviours are time-varying functions which constantly have a value.
Derive a behaviour from an event, or generate a receiver to watch a
particular DOM element, such as an input field.

## Incomplete

* Figure out how to properly perform the multi-arity lift, and replace
  the examples.
* Add a requests! function for taking a series of web requests and
  returning web responses.
